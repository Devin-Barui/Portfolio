# Portfolio

This portfolio contains some of the completed projects I have undertaken as well as those which are in the process of being updated.

Currently the projects involved in this portfolio are:

## UQ NeuroTech Mind-Bot race.

- connect.py
- main.py

Collated Application files for UQ NeuroTech Mind-Bot Race project.

The Mind-Bot Race is a project by UQ NeuroTech which uses the eeg stream data from BrainWear devices to operate a robotic car. The point of the event is to set teams against each other and have those teams compete on the basis of functionality and the sophistication of their methodology (i.e. teams will get more points for crossing the finish line using more sophisticated mental commands).

## Calls (data cleaning)

- calls(parsed).ipynb
- calls.json

This project was completed for Arealytics (a real-estate data solutions company) as a technical assessment for an internship role. The file consists of a JSON file containing call logs as well as their associated meta data which detailed conversation between clients and A.I callers where the A.I was attemtping to figure out whether the client had moved locations or not. My task in this project was to add an additional column(s) which would indicate the status of the address as either 'Address confirmed', 'Address changed', or 'No Result'. Additional columns were added to simplify this process.

The project was very well received by the company.

## PPE Honours Thesis (The Incompletenes of Learning: An Epistemological Study of Machine Learning)

- PPES4202 - "PPE Thesis", Honours Thesis.pdf

A copy of my Honours thesis completed for my Bachelor of Politics, Philosophy and Economics. This paper sought to elucidate the epistemological foundations of Machine Learning and answer the questions of what we may and may not expect A.I. to uncover as technology progress based on the limits of our knowledge. In this thesis, I go in-depth into the mathematical-philosophical foundations of machine learning to demonstrate how our de facto knowledge influences machine learning models. 

This thesis earned me a first class honours for my Honour's degree but was not satisfiably 'an original contribution to the literature' as deemed by the marker.

## Real Estate App (Work-in-Progress)

This is a project I am currently working on. Included is a Jupyter notebook which shows the webscraping collection as well as uploading the output to s3.
