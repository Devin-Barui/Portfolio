# Portfolio

This portfolio represents all of the completed projects I have undertaken as well as those which are in the process of being updated.

Currently the projects involved in this portfolio are:

-- UQ NeuroTech Mind-Bot race.

- connect.py
Collated Application file for UQ NeuroTech Mind-Bot Race project.

The Mind-Bot Race is a project by UQ NeuroTech which uses the eeg stream data from BrainWear devices to operate a robotic car. The point of the event is to set teams against each other and have those teams compete on the basis of functionality and the sophistication of their methodology (i.e. teams will get more points for crossing the finish line using more sophisticated mental commands).
