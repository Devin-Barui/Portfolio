Collated Application files for UQ NeuroTech Mind-Bot Race project.

The Mind-Bot Race is a project by UQ NeuroTech which uses the eeg stream data from BrainWear devices to operate a robotic car. The point of the event is to set teams against each other and have those teams compete on the basis of functionality and the sophistication of their methodology (i.e. teams will get more points for crossing the finish line using more sophisticated mental commands).
