# Calls (data cleaning)

- calls(parsed).ipynb
- calls.json

This project was completed for Arealytics (a real-estate data solutions company) as a technical assessment for an internship role. The file consists of a JSON file containing call logs as well as their associated meta data which detailed conversation between clients and A.I callers where the A.I was attemtping to figure out whether the client had moved locations or not. My task in this project was to add an additional column(s) which would indicate the status of the address as either 'Address confirmed', 'Address changed', or 'No Result'. Additional columns were added to simplify this process.

The project was very well received by the company.
